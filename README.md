# Vibescribe

A live transcription app for collaborative conversations. Built for brainstorming sessions, pair programming calls, and creative jams where you want to capture what someone just said and use it — right now.

Vibescribe shows a real-time, speaker-separated transcript as you talk. When your collaborator drops a great idea, insight, or turn of phrase, grab it with one click and paste it straight into your prompt, doc, or notes.

## Key Features

- Live transcription with speaker separation
- One-click copy on any recent line
- Optimized for two-person calls and brainstorms
- Minimal UI that stays out of your way
- Built for the prompt-first workflow

Stop rewinding. Stop asking "wait, what did you just say?" Start capturing the good stuff as it happens.

## Pitch Feedback

### What's Working

- The use case is specific (brainstorms, pair programming, creative jams) without being limiting
- "Grab it with one click" is concrete and visceral
- The closing lines have good rhythm

### Potential Tightening

- The phrase "capture what someone just said and use it — right now" could be sharper. Already saying "live" and "real-time" — the speed is implied. Consider cutting to the action faster.
- The feature list feels slightly redundant with the prose above it. Could either make the features more terse (bullet fragments) or cut some that are already covered.

### Direction Options

1. **Punchier/shorter:** Cut the feature list entirely. Let the prose do the work. End on "Start capturing the good stuff as it happens."

2. **More technical:** Add a line about what's under the hood (local processing? which ASR? privacy stance?) — useful if your audience is developers.

3. **More playful:** Lean into the "vibe" in the name. "Your brainstorm's highlight reel, live."

## Open Questions

- Primary audience: developers, creative teams, or general knowledge workers?
- Privacy stance: local processing vs cloud transcription?
- Platform: desktop app, web app, or both?
- Integration targets: where does copied text typically go? (ChatGPT, Notion, VS Code, etc.)
